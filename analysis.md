### 🔍 **KEY OBSERVATIONS**

1. **Files & Assets now dominate** (68% of total) – `FileAttachment` and `sanity.fileAsset` have nearly doubled, likely due to uploads.
2. **Transaction volumes increased significantly** – DispatchLog, PurchaseOrder, GoodsReceipt all grew by 300–800 documents.
3. **System logs removed** – `sanityLog` went from 4,942 to 0, which freed up space but was offset by growth elsewhere.
4. **Overall total increased by 835 documents** – despite deleting all logs, the system is now at ~12,448 documents.

### 🗑️ **CLEANUP PRIORITIES**

| Priority | Action | Documents to Free | Impact |
|----------|--------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | **Delete old/unused file attachments** – review files, especially large or duplicate uploads. | Up to 8,518 | 🔴 High |
| 2 | **Archive old transactions** – delete DispatchLogs, PurchaseOrders, GoodsReceipts older than 90 days. | ~1,000–2,000 | 🟡 Medium |
| 3 | **Remove duplicate BinStock records** – if each StockItem has multiple BinStock entries, consider consolidating. | Up to 180 | 🟢 Low |

---

### 📋 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Inspect file attachments** – run this query to see when they were created and their sizes:
   ```bash
   npx sanity documents query '*[_type == "sanity.fileAsset"]{_createdAt, originalFilename, size} | order(_createdAt desc)[0..20]'
   ```

2. **Delete old transaction documents** (example for 90 days):
   ```bash
   npx sanity documents delete '*[_type == "DispatchLog" && _createdAt < now() - 60*60*24*90]'
   npx sanity documents delete '*[_type == "PurchaseOrder" && _createdAt < now() - 60*60*24*90]'
   npx sanity documents delete '*[_type == "GoodsReceipt" && _createdAt < now() - 60*60*24*90]'
   ```

3. **Consider upgrading to Growth plan** if you need to keep all data.
